# Milestone Project One: Japanese Culture Social Club

Ever been interested in learning how to say more than "Konnichiwa"? Want to understand the philosophy behind tea ceremony? Do you think samurai swords look really cool?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, the JSCS Berlin is there to serve your interests. We organize Japanese cultural events throughout the city of Berlin. Membership is free, and we offer a monthly meetup where you can come talk to like-minded people for absolutely free as well.
Other club events, of which there are several each month, are charged individually. Sign-up is risk-free, and you only pay for the events you actually attend.
Through our cooperation with our many Japanese partners, among them companies and artists, we help diversify our city and bring to it rich cultural content.


## UX

The website's target audience is anyone interested in Japanese culture in Berlin. The goal of the website is to increase the number of its members, and thus in time increase the number of events offered.

Membership is free, but the club makes money with each individual paid event. 

### Strategy Plane

On the strategy plane of UX, the following goals are most important:

| Objective         | Viability          | Feasibility |
| ----------------- |:------------------:| -----------:|
| increase members  | 5                  | 5           |
| inform fans       | 5                  | 5           |
| attract sponsors  | 5                  | 2           |

As can be seen from the matrix, the goals of **increase the number of new members** and **inform fans** are both highly feasible and highly desireable, so they are prioritized. The goal of attracting sponsors, while important,  would necessiate features and additional content that are out of the scope for this website.

### Scope Plane

With the goals firmly set, next features needed to be decided upon:

Since users need to be enticed to sign up, a prominent **Join Me** button needs to be displayed. It was thus decided to feature the option to join the club very prominently on the landing page.

Furthermore, the users need to be informed of what it is they are joining. Hence, the rest of the website should be dedicated to fulfill that need, by giving the user easily accessible information on what it is the club does, what the benefits of joining are, and what they can expect to gain from membership.

caught the fact that I've been developing from a desktop-first approach. fixed it with the cards and the cat background.

standardized heading style by using vh top and bottom, except for on the last item 

HTML validator tells me not to use fixed height and width with the Spotify plugins, but the Fiona Apple website begs to differ.







to-do: put button instead of free for monthly meetup card

change hover class of bottom JSCS
